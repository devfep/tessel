# Roadmap

Task list for the work in `PLAN.md`, executed under `docs/BUILD-PROTOCOL.md`. `PLAN.md` owns scope
and order; `docs/proposals/real-use.md` holds the requirements, invariants and done-checks this
file's tasks refer to. Only the orchestrator edits this file. The contest-era roadmap and build log
are in git history (`78bcb9a` and earlier).

## STATE (rewritten at every dispatch, verdict, merge and close)

**As of:** 2026-10-19 07:20 EDT. Merged since the last rewrite: the clone-only `Workspace`
decision (`f4f94f0`, #46) and P1-LANDER-GIT (`e520463`, #45). M1 is done: the mutation job is
required and green, the nightly has run green, the rules check passes, the host types round-trip
and the lander's git tests pass. M2 is dispatched.
**In flight:**
- P1-MOVE-CALLS (lane A, `.claude/worktrees/p1-move-calls`, from `e520463`). The task ends with a
  commit that plants one mutant per moved rule and a commit that reverts it; the orchestrator
  pushes the plant first for the red CI run the done-check links.
- P1-LANDER-MERGE (lane B, `.claude/worktrees/p1-lander-merge`, from `e520463`), with the
  clone-only `Workspace` type.
**Next:** lane A takes P1-MOVE-SOCKETS, P1-MOVE-WAKE and P1-MOVE-REPLAY in that order, each after
the previous one merges, then P1-CLI-ON-HOST; lane B takes P1-LANDER-TRIAL, then
P1-LANDER-ISOLATION. P1-FAKE-HELLO-LOST is decided when P1-CLI-ON-HOST is dispatched, since that
task replaces the fake's orchestration; P1-MUTANTS-PROPTEST-ONLY goes to lane B when it is free.
**Pending from Felix:** the plan's decisions 1-11, 13 and 14 and proposed changes A-D
(`docs/proposals/phase-1.md`). Decisions 1 (no `wrangler dev` captures) and 14 (the CLI's fake
rebuilt on the host in M2) apply to M2: the move proceeds on them as recommended, and
P1-CLI-ON-HOST needs decision 14 before it is dispatched. Tearing down the spike sandbox needs
`gh auth refresh -s delete_repo`; it costs nothing and can stay until Phase 2.
**Stacked pull requests:** GitHub retargets a stacked pull request to `main` only when its base
branch is deleted, so #26 merged into #25's branch and was reopened as #28. Stack no more pull
requests; open the second after the first merges.
**Rule from 18 October:** no synthetic CPU load on this Mac (it broke another project's builds);
load and flake checks run on CI runners.

## Phase 0: foundations

- [x] **P0-CI** (`348c1ff`, #19) — GitHub Actions, every action pinned to a full SHA with its
  version in a comment, `persist-credentials: false`, clean under `actionlint` and `zizmor`. Fast
  lane (target under three minutes): `cargo fmt --check`; clippy `-D warnings` native and for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` with `--features runtime`; the core library's tests. Slow lane: the
  workspace through cargo-nextest; the steward's `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, lint
  and tests; `cargo deny check advisories bans`. A pull request template with a field for the new
  test's failing output (CLAUDE.md rule 9). Known flakes the slow lane will meet are fixed or
  quarantined with a named task, never retried silently (SWARM-ONLOCAL-LOAD-2 below). Done: both
  lanes green on the task's pull request, with measured durations in the report.
- [x] **P0-MQ-PROPTEST** (`f00d10b`, #20) — property tests for the merge queue
  (`src/coordinator/merging.rs`) interleaving every `MergeOutcome` (`Merged`, `Conflict`,
  `TestsFailed`, `ServiceUnavailable`, `MainMoved`, `AlreadyMerged`), cut-off recovery and the
  watchdog with claims, leases, review holds and races. Checks: at most one `Merged` per claim; a
  held submission is never dispatched; attempt counts and bounds (`MAX_MAIN_MOVED`,
  `MAX_INFRA_RETRIES`) hold; state round-trips through serde at every step; the queue never wedges
  (if a submission is eligible, `begin_merge` or the next wake dispatches it). Tests only, no
  behaviour change; a property that exposes a bug is recorded as a new task, not fixed in this lane.
  Done: green at 10,000 cases, with the run time reported.
- [x] **P0-DISPATCH-ID** (`1d29bca`, #22) — a persisted, monotonic dispatch id on every merge and
  verification dispatch, carried by the shell's call, and matched in `merge_outcome` and the
  verification outcome; a stale answer changes nothing (proposal, correctness requirement 5 and I7).
  Done: a property test showing a stale answer is ignored, failing before the change.
- [x] **P0-LANDED-COMMIT** (`4a219f7`, #28) — `already_merged` no longer becomes `Landed { head:
  base }` (`src/merge.rs`); the outcome carries the landed commit when known, and no verification or
  trial is queued until it is (proposal, fixes table). Done: a test that no verification compares
  main with itself, failing before the change. Built: the steward's `already_merged` base is main as
  it is now, not the landed commit, so the coordinator records main at each dispatch
  (`InFlight::main`) and keeps the first one whose answer was lost (`unanswered_from`); a retry
  answered `already_merged` lands with that as `before`. With none, or with main unchanged, the
  landing is recorded but nothing is queued to verify it. No steward change.
- [x] **P0-CLI-REPLAY-UNKNOWN-EVENT** (`5400daf`, #23) — carried over: `tessel-cli/src/daemon.rs`
  aborts replay or drops the socket on one event it cannot parse, so any new event kind breaks older
  daemons. Decode the envelope tolerantly (seq plus a possibly unknown kind) and keep replaying.
  Must land before P0-VERIFY-SLOT adds an event kind. Done: a test replaying a log with an unknown
  kind.
- [x] **P0-VERIFY-SLOT** (`3695300`, #25) — after N merges (setting, default 4) the next merge waits
  if the head verification is ready and not in backoff; `begin_merge` respects a verification in
  flight; dropped verifications are logged as a new `VerificationDropped` event and counted in
  `Summary` (proposal, fixes table, I12). Needs P0-CLI-REPLAY-UNKNOWN-EVENT. Done: a property test
  that a ready verification runs within N merges under continuous merge load.
- [x] **P0-DOC-MAIN-MOVED** (`4a219f7`, #28) — from the P0-MQ-PROPTEST review: `src/merge.rs`
  documents `MAX_MAIN_MOVED` as answers "in a row", but the code counts them per submission (an
  infra failure does not reset the count, which is the safer rule), and `merging.rs` says "up to
  MAX_MAIN_MOVED times" where there are MAX_MAIN_MOVED - 1 re-dispatches. Fix the docs to match the
  code. Small.
- [x] **P0-FLAKE-WALLCLOCK** (`1a458b1`, #27) — at a local load average near 240, two tests fail on
  wall-clock checks in code no Phase 0 change touched: `tessel-swarm`
  `off::tests::agents_work_at_the_same_time` ("branches were built one after another") and
  `tessel-cli` `heartbeats_keep_a_claim_alive_past_its_lease` (once; passed on rerun). Both pass on
  GitHub. Replace the timing assertions with ordering or explicit signals, or move them behind the
  daemon clock seam planned for Phase 1 (proposal, "Flake control"); never add retries.
- [x] **P0-UNVERIFIABLE-LANDING** (this pull request) — from the P0-LANDED-COMMIT review: when a
  recovered merge lands with no known baseline, its assumption verifications are not queued and
  nothing records that they were skipped. Make it visible (rule 7, invariant 10). Decided after
  adversarial critique, at Felix's delegation: a new `VerificationDropped` reason would add an
  enum value to a logged event, which invariant 13 says bumps `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, and its
  `ReleaseReason` would be false (the assuming claim is still live). Built instead: `Merged`
  gains the optional lists `unverified` and `untried_shadows`, and `Summary` the separate counter
  `verifications_unverifiable`; additive, no version bump.
- [ ] **COORD-HEAD-FROM-AGENT** — from the same review: until the first landing or head read,
  the coordinator's `head` is the base the first agent declared in its `Hello`
  (`src/coordinator.rs`), and it becomes the baseline of the first dispatch unchecked. Phase 1:
  read the trunk head from the git host when the repo loads, before any dispatch.
- [x] **P0-SPIKE** (this pull request) — the GitHub spike in the proposal ("The GitHub adapter",
  spike paragraph): does a fork pull request's check satisfy a required-checks ruleset for a direct
  `updateRefs` of that commit; is a stale `beforeOid` refused with the App as bypass actor; check
  and webhook latencies. Done: a written answer in `docs/proposals/` and a script that reproduces
  it. Felix created the organisation `tessel-sandbox` and the private App `tessel-lander-spike` (ID
  5368982; contents, pull requests and administration write; checks, statuses and actions read; no
  webhook) on 18 October. Its private key is kept outside the repository and is never committed.
  Answered in `docs/proposals/github-spike.md`: a fork pull request's check satisfies the
  required-checks ruleset for a direct `updateRefs`, also for the App as bypass actor of the
  update-restriction ruleset; a stale `beforeOid` is refused, but with a generic "Something went
  wrong" error, so the lander reads the ref back; checks took 9-14 s on a trivial workflow; a
  contents-write token is enough to land. Landing is a durable job finished by reconciliation.

## Phase 1: portable host, `tessel-server` and the Rust lander

The plan, its milestones M1-M6, lanes and file ownership are in `docs/proposals/phase-1.md`. Each
task's full text (files, what, done-check) is there; this list tracks status. M1 and M2 are
planned to task level; M3-M6 are re-planned at each milestone boundary.

### M1. Guardrails and the host's types (done 19 October)

Done when: the mutation job is required and green; the nightly run is green once; the rules check
passes; the host types round-trip; the lander git tests pass.

- [x] **P1-CI-MUTANTS** (`1e48ff4`, #35) — lane B. Per-pull-request mutation check on changed
  lines, sharded, with one aggregating required job; a `workflow_dispatch` run for unchanged files.
- [x] **P1-RULES** (`0b6ff41`, #36) — lane A. Every rule in `src/runtime.rs` named, with its
  status ("now", "after move", "dropped") and a script that fails if a "now" row's test is missing.
- [x] **P1-CI-NIGHTLY** (`b3b6c52`, #39) — lane B, after P1-CI-MUTANTS. Proptest at 10,000
  cases and full mutants nightly, compared with a baseline that only shrinks. The first full run
  (39176270373: 904 mutants, shards 26-38 minutes) gave the 33-line baseline.
- [x] **P1-HOST-TYPES** (`9fd80cb`, #40) — lane A, after P1-RULES. The host's `Input`,
  `Output`, `Call` and `CallAnswer` types, no behaviour. Where they differ from the frozen `Call`
  text (decision 12) is listed in #40's description; Felix merged it on 18 October.
- [x] **P1-LANDER-GIT** (`e520463`, #45) — lane B, after the CI tasks. The lander's git layer
  and coverage check ported from the steward, with a deterministic rebase. Git runs with a cleared
  environment and fixed config; repository config is not neutralised, so a test shows a filter
  and merge driver run in an in-place rebase and not after a clone, which led to the clone-only
  `Workspace` (#46).
- [x] **P1-FLAKE-REPLAY-HELLO** (`e283369`, #41) — found on `main`: the slow lane failed on
  #34's merge (run 39165527090, a docs-only change) at `tessel-cli/tests/replay_unknown.rs:146`,
  "the socket was dropped and redialled". Cause: the daemon's event-log read opens a second
  socket whose `Hello` can reach the coordinator after `start` returns. Built: `start_settled`
  waits for the complete-read line; `liveness.rs` had the same race with a wider window and is
  fixed too; a test pins the two hellos.
- [x] **P1-MUTANTS-SHRINK** (`9a875fc`, #42) — from P1-CI-NIGHTLY's first full run
  (39176270373): of the 21 missed mutants outside `src/store.rs`, 18 are killed by behaviour tests
  and 3 are equivalent (`next_to_merge` `<` → `<=`; `recover_merge` and `merge_outcome` `||` →
  `&&`, which differ only in a state nothing can reach). The baseline keeps those 3 and the 12 in
  `src/store.rs` (15 lines). The pull request's nightly also caught `waiters_conflict`, which
  only a proptest had killed, for some seeds; an example test now kills it.
- [x] **P1-HELLO-FALSE-PASS** (`98cb8e3`, #43) — from the P1-FLAKE-REPLAY-HELLO review: every
  hello check across a dropped connection in `tessel-cli/tests/cli.rs` and `submit.rs` now starts
  from a settled daemon, and the replay-frame loop waits for each failed read and its inbox notice
  before the next round. Each check fails when the redial it claims is removed.
- [ ] **P1-FAKE-HELLO-LOST** — from the P1-HELLO-FALSE-PASS review: with a 1.5 s delay at the
  top of `snapshot_task`, the fake coordinator (`tessel-cli/tests/support/mod.rs`) sometimes does
  not count a log read's `Hello` (5 hellos before a third drop in some runs, 6 in others). Find
  whether the fake drops it or the daemon never sends it; `replay_unknown`'s
  `a_settled_daemon_has_sent_a_hello_on_each_of_its_two_sockets` (exactly two) could flake on it.
  Done: the cause named, and a test that pins it.
- [ ] **P1-MUTANTS-PROPTEST-ONLY** — from #42's nightly (39189028810): `waiters_conflict`
  (`src/coordinator.rs`, `||` → `&&`) was missed in one full run and caught in two, because its
  only killer was `coordinator_matches_brute_force_model`, which finds it for some seeds. Any
  mutant killed only by a proptest makes the nightly comparison fail at random. List the mutants
  each proptest kills that no example test kills (a full mutants run with the proptests filtered
  out, on CI), and give each an example test. Done: that run misses nothing outside the baseline.

### M2. The move

Done when: no rules-list row is "after move"; `cargo test --workspace` is green with the CLI suite
on the host; the wasm lane is still green (`runtime.rs` unchanged); the ported steward tests are
green.

- [ ] **P1-MOVE-CALLS** — lane A. The call path moved into `src/host/` with its test driver
  (`testkit.rs`): rows R14-R19, R28-R32 and R42.
- [ ] **P1-MOVE-SOCKETS** — lane A, after P1-MOVE-CALLS. Sessions and the socket table: rows
  R6-R13.
- [ ] **P1-MOVE-WAKE** — lane A, after P1-MOVE-SOCKETS. The wake in today's order: rows R20-R27,
  R38 and R41; decides COORD-WAKE-WHILE-VERIFYING.
- [ ] **P1-MOVE-REPLAY** — lane A, after P1-MOVE-WAKE. `Watch` replay with other inputs queued:
  row R36.
- [ ] **P1-CLI-ON-HOST** — lane A, after the four above; needs decision 14. The CLI's fake
  coordinator rebuilt on the host, same test count.
- [ ] **P1-LANDER-MERGE** — lane B. `prepare` and `land` ported from `merge-steps.ts`, with the
  clone-only `Workspace` type; 47 unit and 14 real-git tests ported.
- [ ] **P1-LANDER-TRIAL** — lane B, after P1-LANDER-MERGE. `run_trial` and the two-sided report.
- [ ] **P1-LANDER-ISOLATION** — lane B, after P1-LANDER-TRIAL. Hooks, filters, a malformed pack
  and control characters in a fork are refused or inert.

Carried-over tasks with slots in the plan: COORD-HEAD-FROM-AGENT, COORD-UNDELIVERED-GRANT and
COORD-WAKE-WHILE-VERIFYING (see "Carried-over tasks" in the plan).

## Carried over from the contest build

Kept, and scheduled where they fit:

- [x] **SWARM-ONLOCAL-LOAD-2** — already done before Phase 0 (the test asserts the order of the two
  `Submitted` events, `tessel-swarm/tests/on_local.rs`); the contest roadmap had left the box open.
- [x] **CLI-GITHOOK-REINSTALL** — already done before Phase 0 (`cdb445c`: a different hook moves the
  old backup to a dated name and is chained; tests in `tessel-cli/tests/githook.rs`); the contest
  roadmap had left the box open.
- [x] **SWARM-PUSH-PHRASES** — already done before Phase 0 (all four phrases are in the transient
  set with tests, `tessel-swarm/src/git.rs`); the contest roadmap had left the box open.
- [ ] **COORD-UNDELIVERED-GRANT** — a `Granted` that fails to send closes the socket but leaves the
  claim held until its lease lapses. Phase 1, in the host (send failure handling).
- [x] **COORD-APPLY-LOADED** — already done before Phase 0 (`apply_loaded` reloads the core before
  applying a steward outcome, `src/runtime.rs`); the contest roadmap had left the box open.
- [ ] **COORD-WAKE-WHILE-VERIFYING** — from the P0-MQ-PROPTEST review: `runtime.rs` (~661)
  calls `next_wake_ms(true, false, ..)` even while this instance is verifying, which looks like an
  immediate-alarm loop during a verification. Phase 1: a host test (I4, "the wake is in the
  future") pins it when the orchestration moves.
- [x] **REVIEW-SENSITIVE** — already done before Phase 0 (`ae62618`: submissions touching paths in
  the `SENSITIVE` variable are held); the contest roadmap had left the box open.
- [ ] **REVIEW-NOTE** — a reviewer's note never reaches the agent. Needs a design (untrusted text,
  rule 3) and Felix's ruling. Phase 3.

Dropped, because the code they concern is deleted in Phase 1 and nothing runs it:
STEWARD-ACCESS-STALE-KEYS, GATE-PATH, GATE-OUTPUT.
